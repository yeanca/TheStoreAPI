## üìê Architecture & Features

- **Clean Architecture**:  
  Uses a folder structure (`Infrastructure`, `Controllers`) to separate concerns and keep business logic independent of data and API layers.  

- **Scalability**:  
  Database schema is designed to prevent overselling with concurrent requests (using transactions).  
  Flexible design allows adding new product types easily with tables for **colors, materials, and attributes**.  

- **Robustness**:  
  Includes structured logging and extensive error handling to provide clear developer and user messages when issues occur.
